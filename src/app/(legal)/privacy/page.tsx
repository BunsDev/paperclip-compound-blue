        <p>
          To exercise the rights described in this Privacy Policy, you or, if applicable, your Authorized Agent (defined
          below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the
          person about whom we have collected Personal Information (such as your Contact or Profile Information), and
          (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each
          request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests
          that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Information provided in a Valid Request to verify
          your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request. We will work to
          respond to your Valid Request within the time period required by applicable privacy laws. We will not charge
          you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly
          unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain
          that decision before completing your request.
